# UniversalAction

**UniversalAction** is a **powerful and flexible action system for Roblox** that allows developers to create, manage, and execute modular actions with minimal boilerplate. With this library, you can define custom actions once and invoke them anywhere—server or client—while maintaining strict validation, logging, and extensibility.

## Features

- **Modular Actions** – Create reusable actions with a consistent API.  
- **Scope Management** – Actions can be server-only, client-only, or run anywhere.  
- **Middleware Support** – Intercept actions before they run to validate, modify, or log.  
- **BeforeRun / AfterRun Callbacks** – Hooks to execute logic before or after any action.  
- **Async Execution** – Actions return promises, allowing chaining and delayed execution.  
- **Action Logging** – Built-in logging for debugging and analytics.  
- **Remote Execution** – Easily execute actions across client and server.  
- **ActionGroups** – Run sequences or parallel sets of actions.  
- **Cleanup & Abort** – Stop or cancel actions safely.
